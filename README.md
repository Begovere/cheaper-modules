# Cheaper-Modules
A repository for the "Cheaper Modules" modification for the game Factorio. This mod is also available for download via the [official mod page](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/CheaperModules) or the download function in the game client.

# What will be changed by this mod?
This mod reduces the price and crafting time of modules.

Tier 1 modules still cost 5 green curcuits and 5 red curcuits (the Vanilla values) but only 10 second crafting time.

Tier 2 modules cost 2 Tier 1 modules of the same type (red and blue curcuits removed from the recipe) and have 10 second crafting time.

Tier 3 modules cost 2 Tier 2 modules of the same type (red and blue curcuits removed from the recipe) and have 10 second crafting time.


This applies to the 3 vanilla modules (Productivity, Efficiency, Speed). Modules from other mods won't be affected by this mod.
